# Project Title

This project uses data sets found on Kaggle and Git Hub containing various written and LLM generated essays. From these essays, we built a Neural Network using SKlearn to predict whether a given essay was AI generated or written with high accuracy. 

## Getting Started

Download all of the files. The Classifer and Vectorizer are the largest files. One all files are downloaded, run the Essay_Predictor.py. It will provide a link for the Flask web serve. Click on it and the application page will open. Enter in the desired essay and it will return the predicted results. 
### Prerequisites

You will need the following:
- Python 3.9
- Flask 3.0
- nltk 3.8.1
- Pandas 2.1.4
- textstat 0.7.3
- Sklearn 1.3.2
- pip 23.3.2 (Important)

### Breakdown of Model

Data provided from self generated GPT essays, collections of LLM essays, and a corpus of Student Essays.
