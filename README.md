# AI Essay Detector 

This project uses data sets found on Kaggle and Git Hub containing various written and LLM generated essays. From these essays, we built a Neural Network using SKlearn to predict whether a given essay was AI generated or written with high accuracy. 

## Getting Started

Download all of the files. The Classifer and Vectorizer are the largest files. Once all files are downloaded, run the Essay_Predictor.py. It will provide a link for the Flask web serve. Click on it and the application page will open. Enter in the desired essay and it will return the predicted results. 
### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9
- Flask 3.0
